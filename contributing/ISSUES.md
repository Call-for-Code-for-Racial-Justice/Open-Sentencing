## How to Contribute in Issues

For any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:

1. By opening the issue for discussion: For instance, if you believe that you
   have uncovered a bug in Project Sample, creating a new issue in the `Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Open-Sentencing`
   issue tracker is the way to report it.
2. By helping to triage the issue: This can be done either by providing
   supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), or providing
   suggestions on how to address the issue.
3. By helping to resolve the issue: Typically this is done either in the form
   of demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more
   often, by opening a Pull Request that changes some bit of something in
   `Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Open-Sentencing` in a concrete and reviewable manner.

## Asking for General Help

The best place to ask for help is through the [Call for Code Slack workspace](https://callforcode.org/slack). You can request an automatic invitation.

## Discussing non-technical topics

Discussion of non-technical topics are also best to discuss in the #general channel
of the [Call for Code Slack workspace][https://callforcode.org/slack].

## Submitting a Bug Report

When opening a new issue in the `Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Open-Sentencing` issue tracker, please provide as much detail about your environment as possible.

See [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

## Triaging a Bug Report

Once an issue has been opened, it is not uncommon for there to be discussion
around it. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue,
including whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This discussion
is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.

Short, clipped responses—that provide neither additional context nor supporting
detail—are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are simply
annoying and unfriendly.

Contributors are encouraged to help one another make forward progress as much
as possible, empowering one another to solve issues collaboratively. If you
choose to comment on an issue that you feel either is not a problem that needs
to be fixed, or if you encounter information in an issue that you feel is
incorrect, explain *why* you feel that way with additional supporting context,
and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often
reach the correct outcome much faster.

## Resolving a Bug Report

In the vast majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request.
The process for opening and reviewing a Pull Request isa similar to that of
opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval
workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and
functional guidelines of the Project Sample project.
